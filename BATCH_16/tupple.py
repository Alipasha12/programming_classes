# CREATE
# READ
# UPDATE => nahi
# DELETE


age1 = (1,0,3)
age2 = (1,2,6)


# ages = (25,20)
# ages = (25,)


### find length of tuple
# print(len(ages))


len(planets)


### data type of tupple
# print(type(ages))


### arithmetic operations
# age3 = age1 + age2
# age3 = age1 * 3

planets2 = planets * 2

print("MERCURY" in  planets2)

### Comparison
# print(age1 < age2)



### Check if an item exist in tupple
# print(3 in age1 )
