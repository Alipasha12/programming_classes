# TOPIC : SET

methods:
1. add(): Adds an element to the set.
2. clear(): Removes all elements from the set.
3. copy(): Returns a shallow copy of the set.
4. discard(): Removes an element from the set if it exists. No error is raised if the element is not found.
5. remove(): Removes an element from the set. Raises a KeyError if the element is not present.
6. pop(): Removes and returns a random element from the set. This is an unordered operation, so you can't predict which element will be removed.
7. in operator
8. type operator

9. union(): Returns a new set that contains all elements from both sets (combining them).
10. intersection(): Returns a new set that contains only the elements present in both sets (common elements).
11. difference(): Returns a new set that contains all elements in the first set but not in the second set.
12. symmetric_difference(): Returns a new set with elements that are in either of the sets, but not in both.
